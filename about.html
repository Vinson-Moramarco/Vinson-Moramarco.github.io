        <h2>Pikmin 1</h2>
        <img src="img/pikmin1.jpg" alt="pikmin1">
        <p>Pikmin 1 is special, as it is the first of them, obviously. That game paved way for some of my favorite games
            in existance and I think that's special. I have many things in common with many of my friends, but among
            them, pikmin, stands as the thing I share most deeply with those around me. So many things in my life stem
            from this simple little game about carrot bois doing funny stuff for the captain.</p>

        <h2>Pikmin 2</h2>
        <img src="img/pikmin2.jpg" alt="pikmin2">
        <p>Pikmin 2 is such a fun game, it's difficulty makes it a much more enjoyable experience in comparison to those
            simpler games, 4 specifically. The length of the game adds to the replayability, same with the cave's random
            generation. I find it superior to the other 3 in the series due to the biodiversity (spooky) in enemies,
            with fan favorites like the bulbmin, and giant fiery bulblax originating from this game. The story was
            simple but effective, olimar wants to go home to his family, but has to go back to the planet to pay off the
            debt which was completely louie's fault, with him in tow, they must go back to the planet and take objects
            from the land to sell.</p>

        <h2>Pikmin 4</h2>
        <img src="img/pikmin4.webp" alt="pikmin2">
        <p>WHERE DO I GET STARTED, the game has been hyped up over around 8-9 years of waiting and it shows. The game is
            just absolutely stunning, seeing it just bring a smile to my face and a warmth in my heart knowing it
            actually exists. Morale was very low on the day it was announced, everyone was thinking "I give up, it's not
            happening." Then, something happened. It started talking about pikmin on the direct, "HOL UP" everyone
            thought, but alas, twas only pikmin bloom news. Until it wasn't, suddenly we get gameplay from out of the
            blue of something, something new. Some doubted it was even pikmin, but some, some of the true veterns
            noticed the spectralid and knew. It had finally happened. Pikmin 4 has finally been revealed to exist, the
            delay between those who knew immediately and the delayed reaction was major, despite being only a few
            seconds. The dwarf bulborb below a park bench let more in on it. After that, the reveal, a bulborb, in all
            it's glory, and the title drop, "PIKMIN 4" with a unique jingle playing. Then that was it, they spoke of it
            for a moment but that was all. Afterwords the hype was at an all time high, 1&2 being added to the switch,
            the demo dropping, THINGS WERE GREAT FOR PIKMIN FANS EVERYWHERE. It did NOT disapoint.</p>

        <h2>Terraria</h2>
        <img src="img/terraria/terraria.jpg" alt="terraria">
        <p>terraria is a really cool game. Almost better than the pikmin games. I have over 4200 hours on it
            in total, thats almost half a year of straight gameplay and it shows.</p>
