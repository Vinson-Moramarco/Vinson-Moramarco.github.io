        <p>redeems the failed portals of past, despite being underground and obscure, the opposite of the REAL
            aether.
            At least this one is able to be found without ruining the hopes and dreams of millions who use console.

        <h2>Crimson</h2>
        <img src="img/terraria/crimson.webp" alt="">
        <p>50% of the terraria community will hate me for this, but I follow the idea that Crimson is better than
            corruption in most facets, with the only inferiorities being music and #3</p>

        <h2>Corruption</h2>
        <img src="img/terraria/corruption.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I'm not one to hate, the Corruption has things going for it, it is all preference though, worm scarf is more
            consistant but less clutch than full damage dodging from brain of confusion, and yes, the music is BANGING
            like crazy, but the boss fight is just a worm boss, which from playing modded, is far too common (DOG,
            Destroyer, Desert Scourge, Storm Weaver, ECT.) despite this, the biome is still quite hype, with some of the
            hardmode items being useful, putrid scent, scourge of the corruptor, cursed flame, but the crimson does many
            of those better.#4</p>

        <h2>Forest</h2>
        <img src="img/terraria/forest.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This is a very nice starter biome. Simple, no specialness to it. just nice forests. Really good for
            making a
            main base due to it being the spawn location and easy to manage. #5</p>

        <h2>Jungle</h2>
        <img src="img/terraria/jungle.jpg" alt="">
        <p>BY GOLLY THIS PLACE CAN BE HYPE AND PAIN, 1, the tortises are painful but give TURTLE armor then BEETLE
            armor, which are both very benificial for melee, jungle armor is the best pre-hardmode mage set imo, the
            weapons and accessories found here help all classes, blade of grass, mana flower, boomstick, and ivy whip
            respectively for their classes, music is banging too. Plantera theme is hype as a Pantera fan myself. #6</p>

        <h2>Space</h2>
        <img src="img/terraria/space.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The enemies here are few, but important, Harpies provide harpy feathers, obviously, but also the giant
            harpy feather, which, when combined with 20 souls of flight (like all crafted wings besides maybe a
            couple make
            Harpy wings, which are good early hardmode wings, for pre-mech activities. Plus the islands found here
            have excellent loot, from the chests, but the damselfish is a great source of income, with fishing in
            the sky
            pools being convienent pre-hardmode for money, and safe, with the wyvern not spawning yet. Still worse
            in comparison to SEVERAL other biomes though. #10</p>

            item
            is mid as heck unless ur doing summoner playthrough. Rolling cacti is my sleep paralysis demon #14</p>
