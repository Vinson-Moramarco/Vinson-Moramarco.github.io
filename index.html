    <h3>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, i aint the sharpest tool in the shed, she was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an l on her forehead. Well the years star comming and they don't stop comming, fed to the rules and I hit the ground running didn't make sense not to live for fun, ya brain gets smart but 'cha head gets dumb, so much to do so much to see so whats wrong with taking the back street, never know if ya dont go, never shine if ya don't glow.</h3>
