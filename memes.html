        <p>This meme is great! The nuance of it, the quality, absolutely stunning visuals, the cameo itself is minor in
            this, the rest is what matters, the instant failure and delivery of the line "Oh no! They were ready for
            that!" absolutely perfect, 10/10</p>

        <h2>Yummers</h2>
        <img src="img/yummers.jpg">
        <p>The boys is a good show, and has many memable moments in it, from "I can't stop" to the iconic "IM STRONGER,
            IM SMARTER, IM BETTER, I AM BETTER!" but this one is just alright in comparison, it doesn't give off the
            same vibe as the other 2 mentioned, it is alright though and gives a good laugh time to time when used
            right. This simple one gets a 6/10.

        <img src="img/zaiken.jpg">
        <p>This meme is so comedic due to the lack of context, its so confusing you can't help but laugh at it. 9/10.

        <h2>Cameo (app)</h2>
        <img src="img/idkwalt.jpg">
        <p>OH MY WHAT ISNT THERE TO SAY ABOUT THIS ONE. There are infinite possibilities for the cameo app/website, as
            you can pay a number of celebrities to say anything your heart desires. The meme potencial for the app, and
            what has already been done is immense. 9/10.</p>

        <h2>Pikmin Times Square</h2>
        <img src="img/pikmintakeover.jpg">
        <p>on the weeks leading up to pikmin 4's release on July 21st, many Pikmin fans similar to me, had the idea to
            put Pikmin content and memes on a Times Square billboard, that can have images on it for a time, for a small
            price. After realising the potencial, they flocked to flood the billboard with memes. For days, all you
            could see was something pikmin related, it was the pinnicle of Pikmin fan's insanity, and for that, it
            recieves a 10/10</p>

        <h2>BarbMinHeimer</h2>
        <img src="img/barbminheimer.jpg">
        <p>Everyone has seen barbenheimer. Only few, select indivisuals have seen the full picture. BarbMINheimer. While
            many enjoyed Barbie and Oppenheimer memes, we fans enjoyed throwing Pikmin into the mix, as Pikmin 4 too
            released on July 21st. the phenomonon's power is unmatched in potencial, similar to doom/animal crossing's
            happening, but at a much higher extent. On that day, everything changed. 10/10.</p>

        <h2>Clouds</h2>
        <img src="img/clouds.jpg">
        <p>this meme is simple, Hank Hill, protagonist of King of the Hill, says "Clouds?" and thats all. It is a very
            simple meme, but one that will always spark joy. 8/10.</p>

        <h2>Vsauce</h2>
        <img src="img/vsauce.jpg">
        <p>Many fear the power this man has, he can do anything he sets his mind to, and it is admirable, but
            horrifying. One imagines the extent of his power, if any. All we can do is hope Vsauce doesn't smack 2 metal
            balls together again, and destroy us all. 10/10</p>
